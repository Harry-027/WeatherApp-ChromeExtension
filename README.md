###App functionality:###
 
1)As soon as the App starts it will try to get your current location.

2)Once your location is identified it will fetch the forecast details of next 7 days for the same location.

3)If there is an error response from API, it will ask you to try again (refresh the page).

4)If it was not able to fetch your current location, it will output the forecast for Pune by default.

5)In case current city was unidentified, User can input his current city manually in the search bar and fetch the forecast results accordingly.
 
 
###App Design:###

1)The App first requests an API: https://freegeoip.net/json/,  to fetch the User current location based on his IP address.

2)Once the Location is identified the Weather API http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily, is requested for forecast results of identified location.

3)If Location API send an error response, App asks User to retry the same by refreshing the page.

4)If Location API sends no location name in its response, App shares the forecast for default location : Pune and gives an option to user of entering  the city name manually in searchbar and get the results accordingly.

5)App extension has been designed / created using Angularjs , Bootstrap , Javascript , Html, Css.
